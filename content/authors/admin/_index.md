bio: Highly motivated researcher and engineer with expertise in machine learning, program analysis, and information security. I completed a PhD in Dual-channel Program Analysis, leveraging the relationship between code and natural language to enhance code completion, vet type conversions, and assess test suite efficacy. Currently, I am working as an AI/ML Engineer at [Hurdle](https://hurdle.bio/), where I develop innovative AI solutions to address health challenges, including the early detection of diseases.
