Highly motivated researcher in program analysis, machine learning, and information security. I recently submitted my PhD thesis on Dual-channel Program Analysis. Used the code and natural language relationship to predict multiple tokens for code completion, vet type conversions, and check the test suite efficacy. I am now looking at research scientist/software engineer roles to apply my expertise and contribute to innovative companies.
