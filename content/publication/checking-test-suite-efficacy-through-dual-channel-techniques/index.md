abstract: Dynamic Call Graphs trace program execution and are used
to model function coverage. They help identify which function calls are
missed but do not offer insights on whether those calls are important
to cover. We propose a weighted representation of control flow called
Natural Call Graphs (NCGs), which can be used to identify important
function calls. These weights represent the relevance of the callee to the
caller and are computed using information-theoretic reasoning on tokens
in the functions. We create a dataset of 1,234 manually verified function
calls, containing a mix of relevant and irrelevant functions, from ten
Python open-source projects. On this dataset, our approach achieves a
peak precision of 78% and a recall of 94% in identifying relevant functions
missed by tests.
