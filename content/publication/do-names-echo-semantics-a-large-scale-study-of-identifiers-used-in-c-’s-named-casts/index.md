abstract: Developers relax restrictions on a type to reuse methods with other
  types. While type casts are prevalent, in weakly typed languages such as C++,
  they are also extremely permissive. Assignments where a source expression is
  cast into a new type and assigned to a target variable of the new type, can
  lead to software bugs if performed without care. In this paper, we propose an
  information-theoretic approach to identify poor implementations of explicit
  cast operations. Our approach measures accord between the source expression
  and the target variable using conditional entropy. We collect casts from 34
  components of the Chromium project, which collectively account for 27MLOC and
  random-uniformly sample this dataset to create a manually labelled dataset of
  271 casts. Information-theoretic vetting of these 271 casts achieves a peak
  precision of 81% and a recall of 90%. We additionally present the findings of
  an in-depth investigation of notable explicit casts, two of which were fixed
  in recent releases of the Chromium project.
